# Baut
Baut is a chatbot that helps recommend you songs and movies based on your relative feelings and personal lifestyle.

## Frontend
The frontend is written in React. In order to start the frontend, simply navigate to the `frontend` directory and execute the following.

```
npm install
```

Once the node packages have finished installing, you may now run the app by doing
```
npm start
```

The React app will compile and a browser should automatically open to `localhost:3000`, where you can proceed with the chatbot interface.
